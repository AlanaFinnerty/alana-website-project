<h2>1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page </h2>
<p>For my website I chose to have a unit for each page to make it easy to navigate. I also choose to add in some extra tabs such as 'About Me', 'Get in Touch' and 'References'. I think this added to the clarity of my website and made it easier to navigate.
    I also started each page of with a heading and kept the font the same throughout for coherence.
    Each page has paragraphs which make the questions and answers on my website easier to read.
    I linked all the tabs at the top of each page so that it is easy to get to each page no matter what tab you are on.
    I also played around around with font size , alignment and colours as well as borders and transparency to make it all look better and easier to read.</p>

<h2>1.5 Copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

<p>"Copyright is one of the main types of intellectual property. It allows the copyright owner to protect against others copying or reproducing their work."[7]

    "Copyright is a legal right, giving the owner control over their work and how it is used. It gives creators protection against use of their work without permission. Owners of copyright can use, sell or licence a work to a third party. Copyright normally protects the work created by the author. There must have been some skill, labour or judgment in the creation of the work and it must be original."[8]
    
    When creating websites it is really important to be aware if any materials you use are protected by copyright. If you upload links or images and later discover you have used them without authorisation you will have to remove them immediately. 
    
    The same applies for any intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and designs.</p>

<h2>1.6 Issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>

<p>When developing a web page it is important to take into consideration different impairments users may have in order to make it more user friendly for them such as people who are visually impaired.
Here are a number of things you can do to make your website more user friendly.<br />Include proper alt text for images- Alt text should be provided for images, so that screen reader users can understand the message conveyed by the use of images on the page.<br />
Use headings correctly to organise the structure of your content-  By using headings correctly and strategically, the content of your website will be well-organised and easily interpreted by screen readers.<br />
    
Use colour with care- Be aware that the red-green colour deficiency, affects approximately 8% of the population. Using only these colours will prevent these individuals from understanding your message.
Other groups of people with disabilities can benefit greatly from colour when it is used to distinguish and organise your content.<br />
To satisfy both groups, use colour, but also be sure to use other visual indicators, for example asterisks or question marks. You can also distinguish blocks of content from one another using visual separation like whitespace or borders.[12]</p>


<h2>1.7 Appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>

<P>While downloading files and viewing websites, you’ll meet up with many file formats. Most are common, and encountered frequently, others are more obscure and require specialist programs to open or use. Here, we have a list of the file types, along with the applications you’ll need to get them going on your computer.

    There are many different file types for websites. Some are more common than others. I am going to go through the most common ones and what they are used for.
    
    File types for images-
    
    .JPEG and .GIF are the most common file types to use for images and web graphics. Both are used for different types of imagines which I will go on to explain in more detail.
    
    JPEG file types are good for photographs and images with colour gradients while GIF file types are good for imagines with text, solid books of colour and which images that have simples shapes and edges.[9]</p>    
    
<p> MP3 is a very common file type to use for audio among others. This are use as the key feature of this file type is the compression that saves valuable space while also maintaining quality. The compression makes it very popular for mobile audio playing devices and is very compatible for many devices.[10]</p> 
    
<p>MP4 is a common file type used for video and also stores audio files, still images, and text. Additionally, MP4 provides high quality video while maintaining relatively small file sizes. (https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/trends/8-best-video-file-formats-for-2020)
    
    Additionally FLV is another popular format for videos used by Adobe Flash Player. It is supported by all video platforms and browsers. The FLV format is a good choice for online video streaming platforms. They have a small file size which makes them easy to download. The only drawback is that it’s not compatible with many mobile devices.[11]</P>
