<div class="myDiv">
<P>Hello, my name is Alana - Welcome to my website.</P>

<p>I graduated with a bachelors degree in business studies in 2018 from Dublin City University and moved over to London shortly afterwards to pursue a passion of mine -Fashion.</p>

<p>I landed job with Hugo Boss UK in their Womenswear Wholesales team and learned all about the buying and selling of premium garnets and all that it involves. During my time here I also learned about the importance of relationship building. Not only with colleagues but also with clients. One of my favourite aspects of the job was being involved in all the buying appointments and being able to understand the process that goes into buying and selling but also being able to build a relationship with the clients that would come in each season to view the different collections.</p>

<p>After my contract ended in Hugo Boss I got a job in Maxmara- a luxury, Italian, Womenswears fashion brand. This time I was in the Showroom team so was heavily involved in the set up of all the showrooms before each buying season. This was also a very client facing role and some of the buyers in Maxmara were also buyers of Hugo Boss so I was able to further develop the relationships I had started to build previously. In fact interacting with clients was one of my favourite aspects of this job.
    I also loved being part of a very fast paced industry and had the opportunity to see how the fashion industry works from a different perspective.</p>

<p>More recently during lockdown I put my business studies degree to some use and decided to set up my own business of making masks whilst also teaching myself how to sew. I saw that there was demand for masks but supply was limited and decided to come up with a more sustainable option of reusable masks made out of 100% cotton and linen material.</p>

<p>I also decided that I wanted to learn how to code after realising how useful it would have been to help me set up a website for my new business. I also think that now more then ever companies are looking for people who have knowledge in coding and understands how it works so I thought Code Nation was the perfect place to start!!</p>

<p>Some other things that make me happy: Music, travelling, animals, New York , fireworks and the color yellow. I have shared these in the Gallery tab at the top of the page if you want to have look.</p>
