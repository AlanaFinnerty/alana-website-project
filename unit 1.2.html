<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.</h2>
<p>I used a couple of different IT tools and applications when making this website. The ones I used the most often were obviously Visual Studio code and Trello and Slack. These were all quite easy to use once I wrapped my head about them. I found that with Trello I wasn't using it as efficiently as I could have could have been during the group project because I had never used it before and it took me a bit longer to get used to than the others. However by the time I had to build my own website and use it again I was much more confident using it and feel like I used it a lot more efficiently and added in a lot more tasks and cards. Our coach recommended adding in a "review" section so he could easily check our work before submitting it which really helped me stay organised.</p>

<h2>2.2 Where the IT tools selected appropriate for the task?</h2>
<P>I think the tools I used were appropriate for the task at hand for a few reasons.
    Visual code was useful for my coding needs, while Trello and Slack were useful for my communication and project management needs. 
    I do wish however that I didn't have to use so many applications for one project. It would be great if Slack had a section to help with the project management aspect like Trello as I was constantly flicking between different windows. I think if I had more than one screen then this wouldn't have been an issue but my work was carried out on a 13 inch laptop screen which is why I found that a little difficult.</P>


<h2>2.3 Strengths and weaknesses of my final project.</h2>
<p>Overall I am happy with how my website turned out and proud of all the work that went into it. I do wish however that I had more time to put into it because I think I would have done a lot more in terms of adding a bit more of my own personality. I like how I structured it and the background which shows users a little bit about me but I think I would like to have included more images perhaps to give it a bit more flair. I think I managed to make it look quite professional which I am very pleased about as I now would be happy to share this with future employers.</p>


<h2>2.4 Further improvements I can make to my project.</h2>
<p>Even though I am happy with how my website turned out there are a few things that I would do to improve it had time constraints not been an issue.
    I would definitely have included more images on each page and also made it more interactive. I would like to have included a "contact me" form on one of my pages. I think this could have added just an extra element that would have been useful also for users of the website. I also think I would have done more to make it a bit more interesting like add in buttons.</p>


<h2>2.5 Review of outcomes- Do they match requirements and are fit for purpose?</h2>
<p>After reviewing all the outcomes I a confident in saying that I have met the brief and all the requirements for this project. For example point 2.2 which stated "Organise and combine information needed for webpages including different platforms " and point 2.3 "Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation".
    I used Trello, Slack and Visual Studio Code to organise all the information I needed for my website. Once my information was gathered I started to code it. I had answered all the questions I needed to include on my website on Trello and was then able to copy and paste that into Visual Studio Code.
    In terms of point 2.4, once I had copied and pasted all the content information I then formatted it all in terms of including headings an paragraphs in the appropriate places and setting font sizes and colour as well as aligning my text. This made my website easier to read through. I also put tabs on each page so it would be really easy for the user to switch between pages and navigate through the website.</p>
