<h2>1.1 What is the purpose of IT in modern business?</h2>

<p>IT is hugely important in modern business as it drives innovation.
    All aspect of business has improved with the help of IT, from marketing to customer support. IT has allowed business to make better more informed decisions and to reach a wider audience while doing so.
    It has become an integral part of how modern business is conducted from multi national corporations to small business. Systems like inventory and data management systems have greatly improved companies efficiency while customer relationship management systems have improved they way they interact with their customers.
    Overall the purpose of IT is to streamline companies traditional ways of conducting business to make them more efficient and innovative.[1]</p>


<h2>1.2 What skills and tools are needed to complete digital projects successfully?</h2>

<P>There are a multitude of skills and resources that are needed in order to complete a digital project successfully both in terms of project management and IT tools. Some of the skills that are necessary are organisation, communication, copywriting, problem solving, team work and presentation skills.
    Some popular project management tools that can that help with organisation and communication and help with team work are Slack, Trello, Diagrams and Github. Depending on the project each of this tools can be a very efficient way to keep track of the project scope and can be good communication tools.[2]</P>


<h2>1.3 How to plan and carry out tasks using IT?</h2>

<p>After receiving the brief to make my own website I had to consider what was the best way for me to effectively manage this project. I wanted to be able understand the scope of the project and keep track of my "To Do" list. 
    For these reasons Trello was the perfect option. Trello deploys the Kanban method which "is a means to design, manage and improve flow systems...". This method is commonly used in project management and after having used it in my last project and learning about how efficient it was, I knew it would work well in this project also. It is very easy to keep track of what needs to be done, what is in the process of being done and what has already been completed. I will include a link to my Trello board here as an example of how I used it to plan for this task.<br />

<h2>1.4 What are the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?</h2>

<p>There can be a number of reasons why digital projects fail. According to research carried out by Forbes some of these reasons include the project scope being poorly defined, lack of communication and leadership and no set timeline for the project.[3]
    Researchers at Enginees found out that "Somewhere between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail".[4] The reason they gave for a lot of the failures was down to the fact that a digital project requires a lot of collaboration. This widens the scope for failure as digital projects are heavily reliant on everyone involved to pull their weight, thus proving the importance of effective communication and use of collaborative tools such as Trello and Slack.</p>


<h2>1.5 How would you go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>

<p>Before selecting which IT systems and software to use for a project it is necessary to analyse the scope of the project. Choosing the right "tech stack" could determine the outcome and is the basis of any successful project. According to Medium "Before proceeding with the selection of technologies, it is necessary to carefully analyse the project and take into account the type, requirements for the project, the experience and resources of your team, as well as such things as scalability, speed, and security."
    Once you have analysed the above necessary components of the projects you can then start researching the necessary tools and systems that will help with each element of the project to make it a success.[5]</p>


<h2>1.6 How technology has helped me achieve my outcomes.</h2>

<p>Throughout this course I have used a number of different technologies to help me along the way. For my teamwork project of building a text based adventure game my team and I used Trello, Zoom, Google Meets, Diagram and of course Visual Studio Code. For my individual website project I have also chosen to use Trello and again Visual Studio Code.
    As the first project was teamwork based it was really important that we used good communication tools. Slack and Google Meets really helped us stay in touch with one another and we were continuously able to update each other on what we were doing and where we were at with the project. Slack also enabled us to be able share useful links with each other as well as share our coding sections. This was really important for us as we had to put all our individual sections together to make one game and without Slack this would have been really difficult. We also used Trello to set the scope of the project and to share our ideas for our game storyline. It was very easy to see what everyone was working on and what was left to complete. Trello also helped me to plan my website project. I was able use it to map out all that was involved in this project and it helped me stay on track. Diagram.net enabled us to create a flowchart of our ideas for our game and we were able to map out each individual mission and all its outcomes. This made it easier for us to flesh out our storyline and make sure it was coherent and made sense. 
    And finally Visual Studio code was the application we used to code both our gaming project and our website. I found this app to be quite easy to navigate and coded all my project work on it. You are also able to download share your file which was necessary for our teamwork project.</p>


<h2>1.7 How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>

<p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address. It applies to all businesses and organisations established in the EU, regardless of whether the data processing takes place in the EU or not. 
    All organisations and companies that work with personal data should appoint a data protection officer or data controller who is in charge of GDPR compliance.
    Any one developing digital projects needs to be aware that failure to comply with GDPR will result in penalties of hefty fines.[6]</p>
