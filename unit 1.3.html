<h2>3.1 Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>    
<p>I think I could have used Slack a bit better for this project. It was an individual project but we did have a 'code-sharing' tab where some other students posted in some tips and different things and perhaps I could have used this better to maybe ask some questions. I think I tired to figure out how to do everything by myself which took a really long time rather than asking for help because then I think I could have had more time to work on the design element of my website. I do also think being in a team for this project would have helped as we would have been able achieve more with the website, rather than one person doing everything. We could have used Trello to divide up tasks between us making us work more productively and efficiently.</p>


<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
<P>In order to be even more productive and efficient I think I would have broken my project down into even smaller tasks. Sometimes I felt a bit overwhelmed with the project tasks and think maybe breaking them down and doing it step by step would have made it easier on myself. 
    I also think taking more screen breaks would have helped me be more productive as it can be quite tiring looking at the screen for long periods of time and it is easier to miss errors.
    Asking more questions would also have helped me be more efficient. I spent a lot of time on the same tasks trying to figure it out instead of just asking questions which I think delayed my progress a bit even though I do think it is important to try and figure things out for yourself I so also think you need to know when to ask for help.</P>

<h2>3.3 Solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>    
<p>I think I would have liked to have been part of a small team given the time constraints of this project. There was a lot to do in a small amount of time for one person who is learning how to code for the first time. Working in a team would have allowed me to include more complex design elements as we could have divided out the tasks between us allowing us more time to focus on different aspects.
    Again I would also have used slack more to ask my coach for more assistance on things I was unsure of which would have help me be more productive and get even more done in the time we were given.</p>

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>  
<p>I think working as a group would have made it easier to spot errors when testing as it is easier when you have more than one set of eye looking at your work. It can be hard to sport your own errors sometimes especially if you have spent a while looking at the same screen. 
    I asked my coach to help me when my code was not working and he was able help me with my testing and give me guidance on where I was going wrong. Sometimes it might have been something as small as a spelling error but it can be hard to spot those things yourself.</p>
